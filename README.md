# Calories Burnt Prediction using XGBoost Machine Learning Algorithm

## Overview
This project aims to predict calories burnt using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. It utilizes a dataset containing various features related to physical activity and heart rate to predict the calories burnt during a particular exercise session.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Exercise.csv: List the features used for prediction (e.g., heart rate, duration of exercise, type of activity).
- Calories.csv: Calories burnt during the exercise session.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab



## Usage
1. Preprocess the data: Explain any preprocessing steps required before training the model.
2. Train the model: Detail how to train the XGBoost model using the provided dataset.
3. Make predictions: Describe how to make predictions using the trained model.
